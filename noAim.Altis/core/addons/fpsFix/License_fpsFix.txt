This script will increase client FPS by 25-50% for missions with a lot of vehicles spread throughout the map.
It must be spawned or execVM'd once on every client. For A3Wasteland, it is execVM'd at the end of "client\init.sqf"
If you decide to use this in another mission, a little mention in the credits would be appreciated :) - AgentRev
